## Project definition
The goal of this thesis is to create a fully functional home automation and security sys-tem.

The subject of home automation has been talked about over the past years, but some-times these systems are not as useful as they are supposed to be. For example, is not it easier to switch on or off the coffee machine or light the traditional way than to use a smartphone or browser to do these simple tasks.

In the bachelor thesis, the solution to the mentioned problem and similar ones will be suggested and in order to do so the system will be tested based on the real life scenarios.

There are home automation products available off-the-shelf. The problem is that they are expensive and sometimes do not offer a solution to some personal needs.

A prototype for the project has been already created. Currently, the system is able to turn on/off a PC remotely or trough voice control. The system is also able to control several other electronic devices. There are some issues with the security system which are planned to be fixed. The system has a graphical user interface that is currently working with some minor problems.

Testing and some additional research is required in order to improve the final results and make a full demonstration of how the system performs.

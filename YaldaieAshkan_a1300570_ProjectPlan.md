## Project definition

### The background of the project

The goal of this thesis is to create a fully functional home automation and security sys-tem.

The subject of home automation has been talked about over the past years, but some-times these systems are not as useful as they are supposed to be. For example, is not it easier to switch on or off the coffee machine or light the traditional way than to use a smartphone or browser to do these simple tasks.

In the bachelor thesis, the solution to the mentioned problem and similar ones will be suggested and in order to do so the system will be tested based on the real life scenarios.

There are home automation products available off-the-shelf. The problem is that they are expensive and sometimes do not offer a solution to some personal needs.

A prototype for the project has been already created. Currently, the system is able to turn on/off a PC remotely or trough voice control. The system is also able to control several other electronic devices. There are some issues with the security system which are planned to be fixed. The system has a graphical user interface that is currently working with some minor problems.

Testing and some additional research is required in order to improve the final results and make a full demonstration of how the system performs.

### Potential Sources

The following book offers useful information that can be used for the project's imple-mentation. The book explains how Python can be used to work with GPIOs and it can be useful for this project.
* Getting Started with Raspberry Pi (By Matt Richardson and Shawn Wallace)

The other book that can be used is covering some basics and instructions of working with the Apache server which are useful to design a Web-UI. This thesis is not covering basics in depth, but some basic knowledge will be required.
* Learn Raspberry Pi with Linux (By Peter Membrey , David Hows)

Vesa-Matti Yli-Heikkilä has created a basic home surveillance system. His work can be a starting point.
* Home surveillance with Raspberry Pi (Bachelor thesis by Vesa-Matti Yli-Heikkilä)

Some online instructions will also be included as sources for this paper.
* Raspberry Pi Foundation URL: https://www.raspberrypi.org/
* Raspberry Pi Spy URL: http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/
* ModMyPi URL: http://www.modmypi.com/
* The Pi Hut URL: http://thepihut.com/
* Tero Karvinen URL: http://terokarvinen.com/

Additional resources will be used for this project, so the complete list of sources will be provided in the final paper. 

### Work statement

This project is set to create a fully modified and personalized home automation and se-curity system with the Raspberry Pi, some additional sensors and external devices. 

Some pictures from the current state of the project are attached at the end of this doc-ument ([Appendix 1](#appendix-1)).

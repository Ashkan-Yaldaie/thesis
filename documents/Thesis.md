## Introduction

### Project questions and objectives

### Project's purpose and scope

### Methodology

In order to complete the paper, a working system is implemented. To test the system, real-life situations and scenarios are created and tested base on the information that is collected from the books and instructions. Of course, some modification is done in order to use the available hardware and meet the  personal needs. The methods are the implementation of the system, testing the project and documenting the results.

## Background

This chapter will introduce the RasPi and its advantages over other cheap single board computers. The reader can find the answer to this question: Why RasPi is chosen for this thesis project?

The subject of home automation has been talked about over the past years. This chapter will briefly go through the concepts of home automation and home security. There are home automation products available off-the-shelf. The problem is that they are expensive and sometimes do not offer a solution to some personal needs. The chapter elaborates some of these problems.

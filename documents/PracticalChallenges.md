### Practical challenges creating a home automation system

During the past years, the automation of tasks became an interesting subject for the developers. Since it is a rapidly developing area, there can be new challenges emerging in terms of creating such systems. This article will cover some of the challenges which I have overcome during the development of my thesis project.
 
The first step for me was to identify the potential users’ requirements and I found out that there are a lot of things which people want to see in a functional system. To overcome the challenge I had to create a programmable device. A system with a number of unchangeable futures was out of the question.
 
The second thing was to find the right platform for the project. I used the Raspberry Pi 2 based on the number of online sources available for this development board. After completing the planning phase, it was time to develop the actual device and that was the next challenge on its own. The budget is one of the important things for any developer, a very expensive device is not very practical for the home users.
 
Using the internet shops to buy the sensors has its own problems. They can be slow to deliver the items and the quality can be bad as well, that is why my next step was to find a reliable shop in order to buy the sensors and devices.
 
Sometimes changing the requirements during the development phase can be a challenge. Such changes can happen due to the new updates or changes in the market. It can be also due to the absence of some licenses. For example, during the thesis project a new development board called the Raspberry Pi zero came to the market. The new board's price is six times lower than the Raspberry Pi 2's.
 
The next challenge is testing the system, finding the right end users and the right location in order to complete the testing. The result of the test can change everything. If the system does not have the correct outcome or does not function well, the development phase must be redone. Testing during the development is one way of testing but a full test is also important to be done in order to see that all the parts can work as one unit.
 
The other thing that I can point out here is to be ready to update the system and take care of the security.  The system must force the users to enter strong passwords. Moreover, access to the home automation must be limited to the actual users of the system. Based on the HP’s report about the home security systems, ten out of ten tested devices are not secure.
 
Physical security is also very important. The device must have a complete instruction on the physical security. The user must understand that a basic act of restarting the system can open the doors to the potential risks.
 
It is also important to look at the market in order to keep the system up-to-date. A good idea can die after a year if it cannot keep pace with the changes in the market.

### Summary

To summarize, I can point out the following as the practical challenges creating a home automation system.

- Collecting the right requirements
- Finding the right platform
- Budget
- Find a good shop to buy the sensors and devices
- New updates or changes in the market
- Testing the system
- Updating the system
- Take care of the security

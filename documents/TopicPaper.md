# Home automation and security system with the Raspberry Pi (Ashkan Yaldaie)

## Subject/Scope    

The purpose of this thesis is to examine different ways of using the Raspberry Pi as a multifunctional device.

The Raspberry Pi is a small computer that is almost as big as a credit card. Raspberry Pi community recommends Debian Linux based operating system for the Raspberry Pi called Raspbian. 

Raspberry Pi can provide different types of servers like FTP, SFTP and Web-Server. Raspberry Pi can be used as a home theater device and so forth.

The Raspberry Pi can talk to the world through its GPIO pins and additional sensors. The Pi needs a 5V 2A power supplier and a memory card to work. That makes the device really affordable.
    
There are tons of books, articles and instructions available on the subject, the real question is how a Raspberry Pi owner can personalize its functionalities.

The goal of this thesis is to create a fully functional home automation and security system. Basics are not going to be covered in depth however the available sources will be listed.

The subject of home automation has been talked about over the past years, but sometimes these systems are not as useful as they are supposed to be. For example, is not it easier to switch on or off the coffee machine or light the traditional way than to use a smartphone or browser to do these simple tasks.

In the bachelor thesis, the solution to the mentioned problem and similar ones will be suggested and in order to do so the system will be tested based on the real life scenarios.

It is possible to collect data from the environment using the Raspberry Pi sensors but how can such information be used to control the home devices.

Any instruction available in books and web articles contain a list of hardware. In order to complete the project, the available hardware to the developer will be used. Purchase of any extra devices will be avoided if it is not really necessarily.
    
## Questions    

Answering to the following questions will help to reach goals of this bachelor thesis:
    
* What are the possibilities to create personalized home automation and security system with the Pi?
* Will such system work in real life situations?
* How user-friendly the system is when created?
* What is the money cost for completing the project?

## Methods    

In order to complete the paper, a working system must be implemented. To test the system, real life situations and scenarios will be created and tested. The information will be collected from the books and instructions, of course, some things must be modified to be compatible with the available hardware and personal needs. There are home automation products available off-the-shelf. The problem is that they are expensive and sometimes do not offer a solution to some personal needs. 

The methods are: implementation of the system, testing the project and reporting the results.

## Potential Sources    

The following book offers useful information that can be used for the project's implementation. The book explains how Python can be used to work with GPIOs and it can be useful for this project.

* Getting Started with Raspberry Pi (By Matt Richardson and Shawn Wallace)

The other book that can be used is covering some basics and instructions of working with the Apache server which are useful to design a Web-UI. As it was mentioned this thesis is not covering basics in depth but some basic knowledge will be required.

* Learn Raspberry Pi with Linux (By Peter Membrey , David Hows)

Vesa-Matti Yli-Heikkilä has created a basic home surveillance system. His work can be a starting point.

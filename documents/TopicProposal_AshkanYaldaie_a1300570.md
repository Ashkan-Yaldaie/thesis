## Name of the thesis

* Home automation and security system with the Raspberry Pi

## Description of the significance of the results 

The goal of this thesis is to create a fully functional home automation and security system. Basics are not going to be covered in depth however the available sources will be listed.

The subject of home automation has been talked about over the past years, but sometimes these systems are not as useful as they are supposed to be. For example, is not it easier to switch on or off the coffee machine or light the traditional way than to use a smartphone or browser to do these simple tasks.

In the bachelor thesis, the solution to the mentioned problem and similar ones will be suggested and in order to do so the system will be tested based on the real life scenarios.

It is possible to collect data from the environment using the Raspberry Pi sensors but how can such information be used to control the home devices.

## Preliminary schedule

* 1 October 2015 – 29 February 2016

## Planned tools and facilities

Any instruction available in books and web articles contains a list of hardware. In order to complete the project, the available hardware to the developer will be used. Purchase of any extra devices will be avoided if it is not really necessarily. Developer’s household will be used to complete this paper.

## Planned working methods

In order to complete the paper, a working system must be implemented. To test the system, real life situations and scenarios will be created and tested. The information will be collected from the books and instructions, of course, some things must be modified to be compatible with the available hardware and personal needs. There are home automation products available off-the-shelf. The problem is that they are expensive and sometimes do not offer a solution to some personal needs. 

The methods are: implementation of the system, testing the project and reporting the results.
